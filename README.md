# Date Night
A simple web application to generate date ideas.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
It employs the newer NextJS App Router paradigm (as opposed to the old Page paradigm) and therefore all components are Server Components unless otherwise speficied.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the page.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load a custom Google Font.

## Theming

This project uses Material-UI components which itself uses Emotion Styled (similar to Styled-components)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
